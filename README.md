# Overview:
This project is a data-driven analysis to find the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh based on the quality of the environment. We have chosen the topics of trees, parks, and waste management to measure the quality of the neighborhoods.  The datasets used are from the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center (WPRDC).

### Datasets Used:
* [Smart Trash Containers](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/smart-trash-containers) - This is a dataset containing data about the smart trash containers throughout Pittsburgh neighborhoods.
* [City of Pittsburgh Trees](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/city-trees) - This is a dataset with data about the different trees that are all around Pittsburgh neighborhoods. 
* [City of Pittsburgh Parks](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/parks) - This is a dataset containing data about all of the parks in Pittsburgh and the neighborhood they are located in.

### Contribution:
Pull requests are welcome from contributors, but please make a new issue to discuss intended changes before doing so.

# LICENSE.md reasoning:
We decided to utilize the MIT licensing because it is very permissive and welcoming for developers looking to contribute to open-source projects as well as businesses looking to utilize our project. We also chose this license because we are not concerned with profiting from our project.

# CODE-OF-CONDUCT reasoning:

We decided to utilize the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct because it sets expectations for how participants will behave when using and contributing to our project. The code of conduct also creates a positive environment for the community. Furthermore, this code of conduct sets enforcement guidelines for violations in the code of conduct and provides a way of contacting project leaders to report abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior.
